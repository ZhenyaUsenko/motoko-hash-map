# **Map** Interface description

```motoko
type Map<K, V> = [var ?(
  keys: [var ?K],
  values: [var ?V],
  indexes: [var Nat],
  bounds: [var Nat32],
)];
```

## Initializing / measuring

### `new`

```motoko
func new<K, V>(): Map<K, V>;
```

Creates and returns an empty **Map**. Empty **Map** has a special optimization and takes only **12 bytes** of space. The **Map** structure will be initialized only after the insertion of the **first** **entry** and will occupy minimum **112 bytes**.

|Complexity||
|-|-|
|Runtime average|**O(1)**|
|Runtime max|**O(1)**|
|Space average|**O(1)**|
|Space max|**O(1)**|

---

### `clear`

```motoko
func clear<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>): ();
```

Removes all entries from the **Map**.

|Complexity||
|-|-|
|Runtime average|**O(1)**|
|Runtime max|**O(1)**|
|Space average|**O(1)**|
|Space max|**O(1)**|

---

### `size`

```motoko
func size<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>): Nat;
```

Returns the amount of entries in the **Map**.

|Complexity||
|-|-|
|Runtime average|**O(1)**|
|Runtime max|**O(1)**|
|Space average|**O(1)**|
|Space max|**O(1)**|

---

### `empty`

```motoko
func empty<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>): Bool;
```

Returns a boolean indicating whether the **Map** is empty (has zero entries) or not.

|Complexity||
|-|-|
|Runtime average|**O(1)**|
|Runtime max|**O(1)**|
|Space average|**O(1)**|
|Space max|**O(1)**|

---

### `make`

```motoko
func make<K, V>(hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K, value: V): Map<K, V>;
```

Creates a new **Map**, initializes it with the single provided **(key, value)** pair and returns the **Map**. The minimum amount of space a non-empty **Map** can occupy is **112 bytes**.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the first argument.

|Complexity||
|-|-|
|Runtime average|**O(1)**|
|Runtime max|**O(1)**|
|Space average|**O(1)**|
|Space max|**O(1)**|

## Inserting / updating

### `put`

```motoko
func put<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K, value: V): ?V;
```

If the provided **key** is not present in the **Map**, inserts a new **(key, value)** pair at the **back** of the **Map** and returns **null**.

If the provided **key** is present in the **Map**, replaces the **previous value** with the provided **value** and returns the previous **value**. The position of the **(key, value)** pair within the **Map** is not changed.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

If the **Map** is empty, on the first insert the **Map** structure will be initialized which will take additional **100 bytes** of space. The minimum amount of space a non-empty **Map** can occupy is **112 bytes**.

Most **put** calls will not cause any space allocations and will be executed in **O(1)** time. If the **Map** is full, on the other hand, and a new **entry** is about to be inserted, [**rehash**](#rehash) will happen, meaning additional space will be allocated, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current entries (either equal or double the current capacity) times **16 bytes**, all entries will be moved to the new allocated space, holes will be eliminated and the operation time will be proportional to the **Map** size.

**Map** being full does not necessarily mean **size == capacity** as on deletion holes (unused array indexes) may (if a deletion happens inside the **Map**) or may not (if you delete the **first** or the **last** **entry**) be created.

|Complexity||
|-|-|
|Runtime average|**O(1)**|
|Runtime max|**O(n)**|
|Space average|**O(1)**|
|Space max|**O(n)**|

---

### `putFront`

```motoko
func putFront<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K, value: V): ?V;
```

If the provided **key** is not present in the **Map**, inserts a new **(key, value)** pair at the **front** of the **Map** and returns **null**.

If the provided **key** is present in the **Map**, replaces the **previous value** with the provided **value** and returns the previous **value**. The position of the **(key, value)** pair within the **Map** is not changed.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

If the **Map** is empty, on the first insert the **Map** structure will be initialized which will take additional **100 bytes** of space. The minimum amount of space a non-empty **Map** can occupy is **112 bytes**.

Most **putFront** calls will not cause any space allocations and will be executed in **O(1)** time. If the **Map** is full, on the other hand, and a new **entry** is about to be inserted, [**rehash**](#rehash) will happen, meaning additional space will be allocated, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current entries (either equal or double the current capacity) times **16 bytes**, all entries will be moved to the new allocated space, holes will be eliminated and the operation time will be proportional to the **Map** size.

**Map** being full does not necessarily mean **size == capacity** as on deletion holes (unused array indexes) may (if a deletion happens inside the **Map**) or may not (if you delete the **first** or the **last** **entry**) be created.

|Complexity||
|-|-|
|Runtime average|**O(1)**|
|Runtime max|**O(n)**|
|Space average|**O(1)**|
|Space max|**O(n)**|

---

### `set`

```motoko
func set<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K, value: V): ();
```

If the provided **key** is not present in the **Map**, inserts a new **(key, value)** pair at the **back** of the **Map**.

If the provided **key** is present in the **Map**, replaces the **previous value** with the provided **value**. The position of the **(key, value)** pair within the **Map** is not changed.

This operation is the same as [**put**](#put) but doesn't have a return value.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

If the **Map** is empty, on the first insert the **Map** structure will be initialized which will take additional **100 bytes** of space. The minimum amount of space a non-empty **Map** can occupy is **112 bytes**.

Most **set** calls will not cause any space allocations and will be executed in **O(1)** time. If the **Map** is full, on the other hand, and a new **entry** is about to be inserted, [**rehash**](#rehash) will happen, meaning additional space will be allocated, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current entries (either equal or double the current capacity) times **16 bytes**, all entries will be moved to the new allocated space, holes will be eliminated and the operation time will be proportional to the **Map** size.

**Map** being full does not necessarily mean **size == capacity** as on deletion holes (unused array indexes) may (if a deletion happens inside the **Map**) or may not (if you delete the **first** or the **last** **entry**) be created.

|Complexity||

|Runtime average|**O(1)**|
|Runtime max|**O(n)**|
|Space average|**O(1)**|
|Space max|**O(n)**|

### `setFront`

```motoko
func setFront<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K, value: V): ();
```

If the provided **key** is not present in the **Map**, inserts a new **(key, value)** pair at the **front** of the **Map**.

If the provided **key** is present in the **Map**, replaces the **previous value** with the provided **value**. The position of the **(key, value)** pair within the **Map** is not changed.

This operation is the same as [**putFront**](#putfront) but doesn't have a return value.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

If the **Map** is empty, on the first insert the **Map** structure will be initialized which will take additional **100 bytes** of space. The minimum amount of space a non-empty **Map** can occupy is **112 bytes**.

Most **setFront** calls will not cause any space allocations and will be executed in **O(1)** time. If the **Map** is full, on the other hand, and a new **entry** is about to be inserted, [**rehash**](#rehash) will happen, meaning additional space will be allocated, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current entries (either equal or double the current capacity) times **16 bytes**, all entries will be moved to the new allocated space, holes will be eliminated and the operation time will be proportional to the **Map** size.

**Map** being full does not necessarily mean **size == capacity** as on deletion holes (unused array indexes) may (if a deletion happens inside the **Map**) or may not (if you delete the **first** or the **last** **entry**) be created.

### `update`

```motoko
func update<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K, getNewValue: (K, ?V) -> ?V): ?V;
```

If the provided **key** is not present in the **Map**, calls the provided **getNewValue** function with **(key, null)** parameters. If the result of **getNewValue** call is a **value**, inserts a new **(key, value)** pair at the **back** of the **Map** and returns the new **value**. If the result of **getNewValue** call is **null**, does no modifications and returns **null**.

If the provided **key** is present in the **Map**, calls the provided **getNewValue** function with **(key, previous value)** parameters. If the result of **getNewValue** call is a **value**, replaces the **previous value** with the new **value** and returns the new **value**. The position of the **(key, value)** pair within the **Map** is not changed. If the result of **getNewValue** call is **null**, does no modifications and returns the **previous value** (which remains current).

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

If the **Map** is empty, on the first insert the **Map** structure will be initialized which will take additional **100 bytes** of space. The minimum amount of space a non-empty **Map** can occupy is **112 bytes**.

Most **update** calls will not cause any space allocations and will be executed in **O(1)** time. If the **Map** is full, on the other hand, and a new **entry** is about to be inserted, [**rehash**](#rehash) will happen, meaning additional space will be allocated, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current entries (either equal or double the current capacity) times **16 bytes**, all entries will be moved to the new allocated space, holes will be eliminated and the operation time will be proportional to the **Map** size.

**Map** being full does not necessarily mean **size == capacity** as on deletion holes (unused array indexes) may (if a deletion happens inside the **Map**) or may not (if you delete the **first** or the **last** **entry**) be created.

---

### `updateFront`

```motoko
func updateFront<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K, getNewValue: (K, ?V) -> ?V): ?V;
```

If the provided **key** is not present in the **Map**, calls the provided **getNewValue** function with **(key, null)** parameters. If the result of **getNewValue** call is a **value**, inserts a new **(key, value)** pair at the **front** of the **Map** and returns the new **value**. If the result of **getNewValue** call is **null**, does no modifications and returns **null**.

If the provided **key** is present in the **Map**, calls the provided **getNewValue** function with **(key, previous value)** parameters. If the result of **getNewValue** call is a **value**, replaces the **previous value** with the new **value** and returns the new **value**. The position of the **(key, value)** pair within the **Map** is not changed. If the result of **getNewValue** call is **null**, does no modifications and returns the **previous value** (which remains current).

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

If the **Map** is empty, on the first insert the **Map** structure will be initialized which will take additional **100 bytes** of space. The minimum amount of space a non-empty **Map** can occupy is **112 bytes**.

Most **updateFront** calls will not cause any space allocations and will be executed in **O(1)** time. If the **Map** is full, on the other hand, and a new **entry** is about to be inserted, [**rehash**](#rehash) will happen, meaning additional space will be allocated, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current entries (either equal or double the current capacity) times **16 bytes**, all entries will be moved to the new allocated space, holes will be eliminated and the operation time will be proportional to the **Map** size.

### `putMove`

```motoko
func putMove<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K, value: ?V): ?V;
```

If the provided **key** is not present in the **Map**, checks the optional **value** parameter. If the provided optional **value** is a **value**, inserts a new **(key, value)** pair at the **back** of the **Map** and returns **null**. If the provided optional **value** is **null**, does no modifications and returns **null**.

If the provided **key** is present in the **Map**, checks the optional **value** parameter. If the provided optional **value** is a **value**, replaces the **previous value** with the provided **value**, moves the **entry** to the **back** of the **Map** (if it's not there yet) and returns the previous **value**. If the provided optional **value** is **null**, moves the **entry** to the **back** of the **Map** (if it's not there yet) and returns **null**.

If the **entry** is being moved from the **front** to the **back**, all holes before the new **first** **entry** will be eliminated and [**rehash**](#rehash) will never happen. If the **entry** is being moved from any **non-front** position to the **back**, the hole will be created and [**rehash**](#rehash) may be called (if the **Map** is full).

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

If the **Map** is empty, on the first insert the **Map** structure will be initialized which will take additional **100 bytes** of space. The minimum amount of space a non-empty **Map** can occupy is **112 bytes**.

Most **putMove** calls will not cause any space allocations and will be executed in **O(1)** time. If the **Map** is full, on the other hand, and a new **entry** is about to be inserted (or moved from any **non-front** position to the **back**), [**rehash**](#rehash) will happen, meaning additional space will be allocated, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current entries (either equal or double the current capacity) times **16 bytes**, all entries will be moved to the new allocated space, holes will be eliminated and the operation time will be proportional to the **Map** size.

**Map** being full does not necessarily mean **size == capacity** as on deletion holes (unused array indexes) may (if a deletion happens inside the **Map**) or may not (if you delete the **first** or the **last** **entry**) be created.

### `putMoveFront`

```motoko
func putMoveFront<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K, value: ?V): ?V;
```

If the provided **key** is not present in the **Map**, checks the optional **value** parameter. If the provided optional **value** is a **value**, inserts a new **(key, value)** pair at the **front** of the **Map** and returns **null**. If the provided optional **value** is **null**, does no modifications and returns **null**.

If the provided **key** is present in the **Map**, checks the optional **value** parameter. If the provided optional **value** is a **value**, replaces the **previous value** with the provided **value**, moves the **entry** to the **front** of the **Map** (if it's not there yet) and returns the previous **value**. If the provided optional **value** is **null**, moves the **entry** to the **front** of the **Map** (if it's not there yet) and returns **null**.

If the **entry** is being moved from the **back** to the **front**, all holes after the new **last** **entry** will be eliminated and [**rehash**](#rehash) will never happen.

The interface of an iterator object is described in the section [**Iterator** interface description](#iterator-interface-description).

All **Map** iterators are reusable, meaning after returning **null** once (at the end of iteration), iterators end up in their initial state and a new iteration cycle can be started without creating a new iterator object.

### `keysFrom`

```motoko
func keysFrom<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: ?K): Iter<K>;
```

If the optional **key** parameter is present, performs a search for it in the **Map**. Creates an iterator object over the keys of the **Map** which starts at the **key** after the found **key** (if the optional **key** parameter is present and found) or the **first** **key** (if the optional **key** parameter is either not present or not found) and ends at the **last** **key**. The iterator can be used to iterate over all keys of the **Map** after the specified **key** with **for in** loop in ascending order. Or you can call any method on the iterator object directly. The interface of an iterator object is described in the section [**Iterator** interface description](#iterator-interface-description).

Note that after the iterator creation, the current **key** will indeed be the found **key** (if it is found). But it will be omitted by **for in** loop so the iteration begins from the **key** right after it. This behavior can bit changed and the found **key** can be included in the iteration by calling [**movePrev**](#moveprev) after the iterator creation.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

## Rehashing

### `rehash`

```motoko
func rehash<K, V>(map: Map<K, V>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>): ();
```

If the **Map** is empty, returns immediately. Otherwise, allocates additional space, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current entries (either half, equal or double the current capacity) times **16 bytes**. Moves all entries to the new allocated space, while eliminating the holes (unused array indexes). Recalculates the hash table (mapping from a hash to the first **entry** in a bucket). Recalculates bucket chains (entries that have equal **hash % Map size** result in a collision and end up in the same bucket). To perform those recalculation, hashes for all keys must also be recalculated.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

This method is usually called under the hood on inserts (when the **Map** is full) and deletes (when the **Map** size is less than **3 / 8 of capacity**). It is not necessary to call this method manually under normal conditions.

## Inserting / updating

### `put`

```motoko
func put<K>(set: Set<K>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: K): Bool;
```

If the provided **key** is not present in the **Set**, inserts it as the **last** **key** of the **Set** and returns **false**.

If the provided **key** is present in the **Set**, does no modifications and returns **true**.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

If the **Set** is empty, on the first insert the **Set** structure will be initialized which will take additional **80 bytes** of space. The minimum amount of space a non-empty **Set** can occupy is **92 bytes**.

Most **put** calls will not cause any space allocations and will be executed in **O(1)** time. If the **Set** is full, on the other hand, and a new **key** is about to be inserted, [**rehash**](#rehash-1) will happen, meaning additional space will be allocated, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current keys (either equal or double the current capacity) times **12 bytes**, all keys will be moved to the new allocated space, holes will be eliminated and the operation time will be proportional to the **Set** size.

**Set** being full does not necessarily mean **size == capacity** as on deletion holes (unused array indexes) may (if a deletion happens inside the **Set**) or may not (if you delete the **first** or the **last** **key**) be created.

The interface of an iterator object is described in the section [**Iterator** interface description](#iterator-interface-description).

All **Set** iterators are reusable, meaning after returning **null** once (at the end of iteration), iterators end up in their initial state and a new iteration cycle can be started without creating a new iterator object.

### `keysFrom`

```motoko
func keysFrom<K>(set: Set<K>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>, key: ?K): Iter<K>;
```

If the optional **key** parameter is present, performs a search for it in the **Set**. Creates an iterator object over the keys of the **Set** which starts at the **key** after the found **key** (if the optional **key** parameter is present and found) or the **first** **key** (if the optional **key** parameter is either not present or not found) and ends at the **last** **key**. The iterator can be used to iterate over all keys of the **Set** after the specified **key** with **for in** loop in ascending order. Or you can call any method on the iterator object directly. The interface of an iterator object is described in the section [**Iterator** interface description](#iterator-interface-description).

Note that after the iterator creation, the current **key** will indeed be the found **key** (if it is found). But it will be omitted by **for in** loop so the iteration begins from the **key** right after it. This behavior can bit changed and the found **key** can be included in the iteration by calling [**movePrev**](#moveprev) after the iterator creation.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

All **Set** iterators are reusable, meaning after returning **null** once (at the end of iteration), iterators end up in their initial state (initial state in this case corresponds to the **first** **key** and not to the found **key**) and a new iteration cycle can be started without creating a new iterator object.

The iterator can be used to iterate over all keys of the **Set** before the specified **key** with **for in** loop in descending order. Or you can call any method on the iterator object directly. The interface of an iterator object is described in the section [**Iterator** interface description](#iterator-interface-description).

Note that after the iterator creation, the current **key** will indeed be the found **key** (if it is found).

## Rehashing

### `rehash`

```motoko
func rehash<K>(set: Set<K>, hashUtils: HashUtils<K>): ();
```

If the **Set** is empty, returns immediately. Otherwise, allocates additional space, equal to the **power of 2** that can hold **8/7** of all current keys (either half, equal or double the current capacity) times **12 bytes**. Moves all keys to the new allocated space, while eliminating the holes (unused array indexes). Recalculates the hash table (mapping from a hash to the first **key** in a bucket). Recalculates bucket chains (keys that have equal **hash % Set size** result in a collision and end up in the same bucket). To perform those recalculation, hashes for all keys must also be recalculated.

Requires [**Hash Utils**](#hash-utils-1) to be provided as the second argument.

This method is usually called under the hood on inserts (when the **Set** is full) and deletes (when the **Set** size is less than **3 / 8 of capacity**). It is not necessary to call this method manually under normal conditions.

};
```

## Moving a pointer

### `prev`

```motoko
func prev(): ?K;

func prev(): ?V;

func prev(): ?(K, V);
```

Sets the **started** flag to **true**. If the **Map**/**Set** is empty, returns **null**. Otherwise, moves the iterator pointer to the previous **key**/**value**/**entry** for ascending iterators and to the next **key**/**value**/**entry** for descending iterators and saves the pointer position in the iterator object. If the current **entry** before the pointer move was the **first** **entry** for ascending iterators or the **last** **entry** for descending iterators, the iterator ends up in its initial position and in the finished state, the new iteration cycle can be started and the method returns **null**. Otherwise returns the **key**/**value**/**entry** which becomes current after a pointer move.

### `next`

```motoko
func next(): ?K;

func next(): ?V;

func next(): ?(K, V);
```

Sets the **started** flag to **true**. If the **Map**/**Set** is empty, returns **null**. Otherwise, moves the iterator pointer to the next **key**/**value**/**entry** for ascending iterators and to the previous **key**/**value**/**entry** for descending iterators and saves the pointer position in the iterator object. If the current **entry** before the pointer move was the **last** **entry** for ascending iterators or the **first** **entry** for descending iterators, the iterator ends up in its initial position and in the finished state, the new iteration cycle can be started and the method returns **null**.

### `peekPrev`

```motoko
func peekPrev(): ?K;

func peekPrev(): ?V;

func peekPrev(): ?(K, V);
```

If the **Map**/**Set** is empty, returns **null**. Otherwise, moves the iterator pointer to the previous **key**/**value**/**entry** for ascending iterators and to the next **key**/**value**/**entry** for descending iterators but doesn't save the pointer position in the iterator object. If the current **entry** before the pointer move was the **first** **entry** for ascending iterators or the **last** **entry** for descending iterators, returns **null**. Otherwise returns the **key**/**value**/**entry** which becomes current after a pointer move.

This operation is the same as [**prev**](#prev) but doesn't save the pointer position, meaning the return value will be the same but the iterator object state won't change after the operation. It also doesn't change the **started** flag.

### `peekNext`

```motoko
func peekNext(): ?K;

func peekNext(): ?V;

```

If the **Map**/**Set** is empty, returns **null**. Otherwise, moves the iterator pointer to the next **key**/**value**/**entry** for ascending iterators and to the previous **key**/**value**/**entry** for descending iterators but doesn't save the pointer position in the iterator object. If the current **entry** before the pointer move was the **last** **entry** for ascending iterators or the **first** **entry** for descending iterators, returns **null**. Otherwise returns the **key**/**value**/**entry** which becomes current after a pointer move.

This operation is the same as [**next**](#next) but doesn't save the pointer position, meaning the return value will be the same but the iterator object state won't change after the operation. It also doesn't change the **started** flag.

### `movePrev`

```motoko
func movePrev(): Iter<K>;

func movePrev(): Iter<V>;

func movePrev(): Iter<(K, V)>;
```

Sets the **started** flag to **true**. If the **Map**/**Set** is empty, returns the iterator object. Otherwise, moves the iterator pointer to the previous **key**/**value**/**entry** for ascending iterators and to the next **key**/**value**/**entry** for descending iterators and saves the pointer position in the iterator object. If the current **entry** before the pointer move was the **first** **entry** for ascending iterators or the **last** **entry** for descending iterators, the iterator ends up in its initial position and in the finished state and the new iteration cycle can be started. Returns the iterator object.

This operation is the same as [**prev**](#prev) but always returns the iterator object.

Otherwise, moves the iterator pointer to the next **key**/**value**/**entry** for ascending iterators and to the previous **key**/**value**/**entry** for descending iterators and saves the pointer position in the iterator object. If the current **entry** before the pointer move was the **last** **entry** for ascending iterators or the **first** **entry** for descending iterators, the iterator ends up in its initial position and in the finished state and the new iteration cycle can be started. Returns the iterator object.

func hashText(key: Text): Nat32;
```

Converts the **key** to a **UTF-8** encoded blob. Calculates the hash using the internal hash function for blob, which is based on the **CRC32** algorithm. Drops **2** most significant bits of the hash to prevent it going to the heap. Returns the hash.

This function is exposed separately, although most of the time you will be using it as a part of [**thash**](#thash).

> **NOTE:** Currently, this is the only hash function in the library that can (occasionally) allocate additional temporary space. Allocation happens at the **text to blob** conversion step (when the internal text representation consists of multiple substrings). This will be a subject to change when we have optimized **for in** text iteration that does not create an iterator object under the hood.
